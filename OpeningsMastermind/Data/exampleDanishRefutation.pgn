1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 (3... d5 { A very nice "take-out" line to have in your back pocket. Black immediately strikes back, forcing a liquidation of center pawns and leading to an IQP structure in which Black's rapid development and active queen will grant us excellent, straightforward play. Should White respond correctly, this move does not afford us an objective advantage, but it is a great move to play in ultra-short time control games (such as in bullet) and, if caught unaware, White can absolutely slide into a miserable position in just a few short moves. Perhaps the biggest appeal of this line is that the lines are quite forcing, making it very easy to memorize in just a few short minutes. } 4. exd5 (4.

The queen aims at the e4 pawn, taking the sting out of the knight jump on d5. More importantly, the queen yields the right-of-way to the knight, which will now develop to its most active square. } 9.

On Lichess, it has only been played ONCE (out of a total of more than 100 games, 79 of which featured the much more natural 7.g3). Abandoning the attack on f7 signifies that White is fully aware of the dangers involved in capturing on f7 and weakening the kingside with 7.g3.

Encouragingly, it has been played in only around 2.5 thousand games on Lichess (compared to a staggering 40,000 and 22,000 in Nc3 and Nd2, respectively). White uses the bishop trade to get his knight into better position, and restrict its vis-a-vis from accessing the e4-square.

Crucially, we will re-develop the knight to h6, from where it can acccess the center through f5. The tension between the bishops on the queenside prevents White from easily accessing the d5-square with his knight.
